I was atttempting to create a (what I thought was going to be) simple bar plot of the co-location activity types on the x axis and the frequency of those uses on the y axis. But I want it to go in descending order expect for "other" which I think should be last. I have tried SO many different formatting types but no matter what I do, the ggplot spits out this stupid graph that is in the wrong order. 
![Every damn time](figures/ocean_activities_bar.jpeg)
Literally every time this is what it shows me. If you can figure out how to reorder this to the following order (on the x axis), I will buy you so much skittle beer and mac you wont know what to do with it all: "wind", "wave", "aquaculture", "tidal", "other".

I APPRECIATE YOU TO NO END <3

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#attach packages

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(plotly)
```


```{r}
# I had to clean data to put it in tidy format

types <- read_csv(here("data", "data_types_tidy.csv"))
```


```{r}
# wrangling to group by types of co-location

types_tidy <- types %>% 
  select(first_author, year, title, activity_present) %>% 
  mutate(activity_present = as.factor(activity_present)) %>% 
  group_by(activity_present) %>% 
  summarize(act_count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(-act_count) %>% 
  na.omit()


```

## Data wrangling
```{r}
# trying creating a new data frame for the values so maybe the ggplot will be happier

colnames_v1 <- c("wind", "wave", "aquaculture", "tidal", "other")

types_counts <- c(types_tidy$act_count[1],
                  types_tidy$act_count[2],
                  types_tidy$act_count[3],
                  types_tidy$act_count[5],
                  types_tidy$act_count[4])


types_tidy_new <- data.frame(colnames_v1, types_counts)
```

## Plotting
```{r}
# types of co-location
### this needs to be fixed so that the data are in descending order. Not sure whats wrong

g2 <- ggplot(data = types_tidy_new, aes(x = as.factor(colnames_v1), y = types_counts)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', fill = "darkgray", width = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Activity type",
       y = "Count",
         title = "Frequency of co-located activity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

ggplotly(g2)
```
